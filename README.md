# 📤 Simple-File-Sharing-App

Simple File Sharing App is a Python GUI tool that lets you send and receive files over a local network using sockets. It shows your IP, lets you enter the receiver’s IP, and transfers files securely with file size verification. Easy, fast, and cross-platform with a user-friendly interface.

A lightweight Python GUI application to send and receive files over a local network using sockets. Built with Tkinter for easy use.

# 🚀 Usage

### 🖥️ On the receiver’s machin
• Launch the app and click **"Receive File"** to start listening for incoming files.  
• The app will display your **local IP address**.

---

### 📤 On the sender’s machine
• Enter the receiver’s IP address in the input box.  
• Click **"Send File"** and select the file you want to send.

---

### 🔁 File Transfer Process
• The receiver will be prompted to choose where to save the file.  
• After the transfer completes, you will see a success or error notification.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works
• Uses **TCP sockets** on port `5000` for file transfer  
• Sends **metadata** (filename length, filename, and filesize) before actual file data  
• Transfers file data in **chunks** to handle large files efficiently  
• Runs the receiver in a **separate thread** to keep the GUI responsive

---

### ⚠️ Notes
• Make sure both machines are on the **same local network** and can reach each other’s IP on port `5000`  
• Firewalls may need to be configured to allow traffic on port `5000`
